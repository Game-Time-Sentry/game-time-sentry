# Game  Time Sentry

> Proof of concept. Work in progress...

## What is Game Time Sentry?

This is a simple background application for tracking game time. It's designed to work only in a Windows environment.

## Background and Motivation

Starting from the old time of XFire, it became a fascinating idea to track game time in PC games. The journey of gaming services such as XFire was not easy. After XFire was Raptr, a user had to migrate the database of tracked games whenever a new service would appear. After migrating from Raptr, I discovered Gameplay Time Tracker (an Offline Windows Application) was a huge safety net and the revelation that tracking games should not necessarily be a service. Discovering later that Gameplay Time Tracker is a closed source was not a concern until learning a few months ago that the dedicated site is down. It looks like this small amazing piece of software is abandoned, and it's a matter of time before it will become broken, maybe with the next big Windows update or something like that.

Over the years, I became extra interested in the idea of tracking game time and would occasionally check gaming time over the months. It does not feel great imagining moving forward without tracking game time at all. This is an open-source project. I'm creating this application to cover my basic future needs in-game tracking. It also opens the doors for the community to maintain it should the necessity arise.
